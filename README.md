AICRM is the front-end interface for a suite of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications enhanced with the power of Dataoorts AI. This project showcases a modern, visually appealing user interface designed with a dark theme, glowing effects, and responsive layouts.

The initial service presented is **AI Email Verification**, which goes beyond traditional checks by leveraging Dataoorts AI models to predict user profiles and provide deeper deliverability insights. More AI-powered CRM services are planned for the future.
